# Prim's minimal Spanning Tree algorithm
  A tree is a graph of vertices and edges without a cycle.
  
  A spanning tree has all vertices connected and is constructed from the graph, and a graph
  
  can have multiple spanning trees.
  
  A minimal spanning tree is a spanning tree whose sum of weights of edges is the
  minimum.
